# MachineLearningWithPython
My first machine learning project

Asking the right question: 
"Use the Machine Learning Workflow to process and transform Pima Indian data to create a prediction model. 
This model must predict which people are likely to develop diabetes with 70% or greater accuracy"


Machine Learning Workflow
 1. Asking the right question
 2. Preparing data
 3. Selecting the algorithm
 4. Training the model 
 5. Testing the model
 
 
Machine Learning Workflow Guidelines
 1. Early steps are most important - Each step depends on previous steps
 2. Expect to go backwards - Later knowledge effects previous steps 
 3. Data is never as you need it - Data will have to be altered
 4. More data is better - More Data => Better Results
 5. Think before acting - Understand results before changing data or model
 6. Don't pursue a bad solution - Reevaluate, fix or quit
